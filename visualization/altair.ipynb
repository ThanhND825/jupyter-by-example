    "# Data Visualization with Altair / Vega\n",
    "\n",
    "[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a declarative statistical visualization library, based on the [Vega](http://vega.github.io/vega) and [Vega-Lite](http://vega.github.io/vega-lite) grammar of graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to install the `altair` and `vega` Python packages, plus possibly `vega_dataset` if you want to work on their examples. Altair needs at least Python 3.5.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation\n",
    "\n",
