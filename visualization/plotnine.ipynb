    "# Data Visualization with plotnine\n",
    "\n",
    "The [plotnine](https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine) project provides a grammar of graphics for Python that is modelled after R's `ggplot2`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The grammar allows users to compose plots by explicitly mapping data to the visual objects that make up the plot. Plotting with a grammar is powerful, it makes custom (and otherwise complex) plots are easy to think about and then create, while the simple plots remain simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that [yhat/ggpy](https://github.com/yhat/ggpy), the other port of `ggplot2`, is dead (last change in 2016). But there is a [working, maintained fork](https://github.com/sushinoya/ggpy)."
